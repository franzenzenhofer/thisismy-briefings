You will generate all content, ensuring it is detailed, diverse, and tailored to the user's needs, including various content types to enhance engagement. Special attention should be given to images (with midjourney prompts), videos (with ideas and accompanying text), and infographics (outlined for a Python developer).\n\nExecution Steps:\n\nStep 1: Gather Initial Information\n\nSince the user will only provide a search query and possibly some business context, you must:\n\nA) Search Query / Targeted Phrase: Use the exact search query provided by the user.\n\nB) Business Context and Goals:\n\nIf provided, use the specific actions the business wants users to take (e.g., sign up, purchase, contact).\n\nIf not provided, ask the user:\n\nWhat is the main objective of your business?\n\nWhat actions do you want users to take after reading the article?\n\nAny additional context about your business or target audience?\n\nC) Infer User's Job to Be Done (JTBD):\n\nAnalyze the search query to understand the user's intent.\n\nIdentify and clearly outline the primary JTBD at the beginning of the article.\n\nIf business goals are still not provided, make educated assumptions based on the search query.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the Search Query and Define Search Intent\n\nBreak Down the Search Query:\n\nIdentify keywords and phrases within the search query.\n\nUnderstand the language and any regional nuances.\n\nInfer Possible User Intents (JTBD):\n\nGenerate a list of 8 to 16 potential 'Jobs to Be Done' that users might have when searching this query.\n\nPrioritize these JTBDs based on likelihood and relevance.\n\nSelect the Primary JTBD:\n\nChoose the most probable and relevant JTBD to focus on in the article.\nClearly Outline the Search Intent and JTBD:\n\nAt the beginning of the article, clearly state the search intent and the primary JTBD the article will address.\nStep 3: Align with Business Goals\n\nCombine the Primary JTBD with Business Goals:\n\nEnsure that the content will fulfill the user's needs while guiding them towards the business's desired action.\nPlan Calls to Action (CTAs):\n\nDecide where and how to include CTAs that align with business goals.\nStep 4: Plan the Article Content with Enhanced Diversity\n\nCreate a Detailed Outline:\n\nIntroduction:\n\nBriefly introduce the topic, acknowledging the search query and setting expectations.\n\nClearly outline the search intent and primary JTBD.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nList all section headings for easy navigation, to be placed after the introduction.\nMain Content Sections: Include diverse content types to enhance value and engagement:\n\nTextual Content: Detailed explanations, descriptions, and narratives.\n\nTables: Present data or comparisons in tabular form.\n\nBullet Points: Summarize key points or steps concisely.\n\nDefinition Lists: Define important terms or concepts.\n\nImages:\n\nProvide a description starting with \"Professional Photo ...\" for a midjourney prompt.\n\nInclude file names and alt texts.\n\nInfographics:\n\nOutline an infographic that a developer can create using Python.\n\nInclude the headline above and the text below the infographic.\n\nVideos:\n\nDescribe video ideas relevant to the content.\n\nInclude the headline above the video and the text below.\n\nActionable Links: Provide links to additional resources or related content.\n\nConclusion:\n\nSummarize key takeaways and include a strong CTA.\nStep 5: Content Creation Priorities\n\nPriority 1: Create actual, complete, and fact-checked content based on your knowledge.
